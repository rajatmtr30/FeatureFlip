## üì± **Overview**

FeatureFlip is an innovative mobile web application that transforms how users interact with their devices. By simply rotating your mobile device, you can access four completely different features, each optimized for its specific orientation.

### üéØ **Core Concept**
Instead of traditional app navigation, FeatureFlip uses **device orientation** as the primary interface. This creates an intuitive, gesture-based interaction that feels natural and engaging.

1. Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Get your free API key
3. Replace the placeholder in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   this.weatherApiKey = 'YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE';
   ```

## Browser Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:
- **Location**: Required for weather feature
